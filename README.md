## Day 14 Final Project - 100 Days of Python 

### Higher-Lower Game

This is a simple higher-lower game designed in Python. The player guesses which of two randomly chosen people have higher follower counts on Twitter. The score is tracked and the game is lost if the wrong person is guessed. The code itself is kept as simple as possible to stay in line with the 100 days of code course.
